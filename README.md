# Rpi_play1
Playing around in Rpi and seeing if I can git onto it  
Learning more about git as well since is removing passwords

This is where the files I make while testing features and playing with Python for Raspberry Pi control will go  
This will probably contain all the learning and conceptual programs I make to try specific features 

## No dedicated projects in here
